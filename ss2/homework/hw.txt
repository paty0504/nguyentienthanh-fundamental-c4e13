1. A Boolean value is either true or false. In Python, the two Boolean values are True and False (the capitalization must be exactly as
shown), and the Python type is bool.
   Ex. 5 == 6 >> False
       5 == (1 + 4) >> True
      j = "hel"
      j + "lo" == "hello" >> True
3. Nested conditionals are the conditionals that could be nested within each other.
   Ex. if x < 20:
          ....
       else:
          if x < 30:
           .......
          else:
           .......
2. A flowchart is a chart that shows the conditions of one program.
